Project: 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO


0. Implement the push and pall opcodes.
	- The opcode push pushes an element to the stack.
	- The opcode pall prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack.

1. Implement the pint opcode.
	- The opcode pint prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

2. Implement the pop opcode.
	- The opcode pop removes the top element of the stack.

3. Implement the swap opcode.
	- The opcode swap swaps the top two elements of the stack.

4. Implement the add opcode.
	- The opcode add adds the top two elements of the stack.

5. Implement the nop opcode.
	- The opcode nop doesn’t do anything.

6. Implement the sub opcode.
	- The opcode sub subtracts the top element of the stack from the second top element of th	e stack.

7. Implement the div opcode.
	- The opcode div divides the second top element of the stack by the top element of the st	ack.

8. Implement the mul opcode.
	- The opcode mul multiplies the second top element of the stack with the top element of t	he stack.

9. Implement the mod opcode.
	- The opcode mod computes the rest of the division of the second top element of the stack	 by the top element of the stack.

10. Every good language comes with the capability of commenting. When the first non-space character of a line is #, treat this line as a comment (don’t do anything).

11. Implement the pchar opcode.
	- The opcode pchar prints the char at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

12. Implement the pstr opcode.
	- The opcode pstr prints the string starting at the top of the stack, followed by a new l	ine.
